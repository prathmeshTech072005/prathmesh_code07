    <li>Ganesh wrote the Mahabharata as dictated by Vyasa</li>

    <li>According to the strict rules of Hindu iconography, Ganesh figures with only two hands are taboo. Hence, Ganesh figures are most commonly seen with four hands which signify their divinity. Some figures may be seen with six, some with eight, some
      with ten, some with twelve and some with fourteen hands, each hand carrying a symbol which differs from the symbols in other hands. There are about 57 symbols in all, according to the findings of research scholars.</li>
    <li>Ganesh created by his mother Parvati as the most handsome in the land was to guard her door from any who would enter had his head severed by his unknowing father Shiva. Upon learning that this was his son he sent his followers to bring the head of
      the first living creature they came in contact with. This is where the elephant head comes from.</li>
    <li>Shiva, after reviving his son decreed that ever more Ganesh would preceed all others in acts of devotion by his followers.</li>
